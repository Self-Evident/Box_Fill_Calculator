# The Box Fill Calculator

### The Box Fill Calculator, or BFC, calculates electrical box fill allowances based on NEC 314.16(B) rules.

* Calculations are performed automatically on every input!
* Instantly see changes to the Total Allowance & suggested box list as you type!<br>
 &nbsp; (If your screen is big enough to see both the input & results tables, of course.)
* Lists suitable standard box sizes based on the calculated Total Allowance!
* And of course, and better than ever before, it does absolutely nothing else!

BFC is a single file of HTML & Javascript, and can reside on and run from your local computer/device. No web server or internet connection is needed (except to download it, of course).  Just download & save the file someplace convenient, and open it in your favorite browser (Firefox/Chrome/Edge/etc...).

## Requirements
A recent browser - updated 2016 or later.

(Older browsers might work, but I don't know...)

## Disclaimer
## No guarantees are made as to the accuracy of calculations or compliance with local codes.  Verify all calculations with a professional, licensed, electrician. 

## Warning!

Also, BFC is highly addictive, so use in moderation. If you're not carefull, you will suddendly find youself with every switch, outlet, and junction box in the house open, just so you can "verify" that all their fills "meets code".  Then, because that won't be enough, you'll find youself doing the same for your neighbors.  All of them.  While they're on vacation, so as to not inconvenience them (and you might have forgotten ask first).  Then comes extended family & friends...

Then, the ultimate realization will come that it would probably just be better to rewire the entire house, just to be sure.  And of course, all the others too...

Anyway, you've been warned.

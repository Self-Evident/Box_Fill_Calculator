# The Box Fill Calculator

### The Box Fill Calculator, or BFC, calculates electrical box fill allowances based on NEC 314.16(B) rules.

* Calculations are performed automatically on every input!
* Instantly see changes to the Total Allowance & suggested box list as you type!
(If your screen is big enough to see both the input & results tables, of course.)
* Lists suitable standard box sizes based on the calculated Total Allowance.

### Download: [current version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Self-Evident/Box_Fill_Calculator/master/Box_Fill_Calculator.html)

BFC is a single file of HTML & Javascript, and can reside on and run from your local computer/device. No web server or internet connection is needed (except to download it, of course).  Just download & save the file someplace convenient, and open it in your favorite browser (Firefox/Chrome/Edge/etc...).
